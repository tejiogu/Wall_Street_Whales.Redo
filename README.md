# Wall_Street_Whales.Redo
A comprehensive financial 'whale analysis', involving multiple aspects of quantitative finance that includes portfolio returns, risk analysis, and portfolio performance metrics. Highlight: I investigate the performance and risk of a custom portfolio in comparison to some existing portfolios and the broader market, as represented by the S&amp;P 500.
